However, if you want to play Warlords 4: Heroes of Etheria on your PC, you might encounter a problem: the game requires a CD to run. This can be inconvenient if you have lost or damaged your original CD, or if you want to play the game on a laptop without a CD drive. Fortunately, there is a solution: you can use a no-CD patch or a fixed EXE file that will allow you to play the game without inserting the CD.
 
## What is a No-CD Patch or a Fixed EXE File?
 
A no-CD patch or a fixed EXE file is a modified version of the original executable file of the game that bypasses the CD check. This means that you can run the game without having to insert the CD every time. A no-CD patch or a fixed EXE file can also fix some bugs or errors that might occur in the original version of the game.

However, before you use a no-CD patch or a fixed EXE file, you should be aware of some risks and limitations. First of all, using a no-CD patch or a fixed EXE file might violate the terms of service or the end-user license agreement of the game. Therefore, you should only use them if you own a legitimate copy of the game and if you are not planning to distribute or sell them. Second, using a no-CD patch or a fixed EXE file might make the game incompatible with some patches, updates, mods, or online features. Therefore, you should always backup your original files before applying any modifications. Third, using a no-CD patch or a fixed EXE file might expose your computer to viruses, malware, or other harmful software. Therefore, you should always scan any files that you download from the internet with an antivirus program before running them.
