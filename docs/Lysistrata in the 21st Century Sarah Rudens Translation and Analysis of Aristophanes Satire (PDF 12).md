Sarah Ruden, a poet and classicist, has translated Aristophanes' comic masterpiece Lysistrata into English with notes and topical commentaries. Her translation, published by Hackett Publishing Company in 2003, aims to be funny, accessible and informative for students and general readers alike.
 
Lysistrata is a play about a group of women who decide to withhold sex from their husbands until they agree to end the Peloponnesian War. The women occupy the Acropolis, where the treasury is located, and resist the attempts of the men to force them out. The play is full of sexual innuendo, political satire and absurd humor.

Ruden's translation renders the dialogue in blank verse and the songs in lyric meters and free verse. She tries to capture the tone and style of Aristophanes' original Greek, while also making it lively and contemporary for a modern audience. She uses slang, puns, rhymes and alliteration to convey the comic effect of the play.

The notes and commentaries that accompany the translation provide useful background information on Athenian democracy, ancient Greek warfare, Athenian women and Greek comedy. They also explain some of the references and jokes that may be obscure or unfamiliar to today's readers. Ruden also includes a selected bibliography for further reading.
 
Ruden's translation of Lysistrata is a welcome addition to the existing versions of this classic play. It is faithful to the spirit and meaning of Aristophanes' text, while also being entertaining and engaging for a modern audience. It is suitable for both academic and recreational purposes.
  
One of the strengths of Ruden's translation is that she does not shy away from the sexual and political aspects of the play. She does not censor or soften the language or the situations that Aristophanes presents. She also does not impose a modern feminist or pacifist agenda on the play, but rather lets it speak for itself.
 
Another strength of Ruden's translation is that she preserves the diversity and complexity of the characters. She does not reduce them to stereotypes or caricatures, but rather gives them individual voices and personalities. She also shows the contrast and conflict between the different groups of women and men, as well as the common ground and reconciliation that they eventually reach.
 
A possible weakness of Ruden's translation is that some of her choices may seem too colloquial or anachronistic for some readers. For example, she uses words like "dude", "babe" and "wimp" to translate some of the Greek terms. She also uses modern references like "CNN" and "Starbucks" to make some of the jokes more relevant. Some readers may find these choices amusing and appropriate, while others may find them distracting and inappropriate.
 
Overall, Ruden's translation of Lysistrata is a refreshing and enjoyable rendition of this ancient comedy. It captures the humor, the drama and the message of Aristophanes' play, while also making it accessible and appealing to a modern audience. It is a translation that deserves to be read and appreciated by anyone who loves literature and laughter.
